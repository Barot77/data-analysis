📊 Diwali Sale Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a major Diwali shopping event using Python. The objective is to extract meaningful insights into customer behavior, product preferences, and purchasing trends, which can help businesses optimize marketing strategies and inventory planning.

📌 Key Objectives:

* Understand consumer purchasing behavior during Diwali sales.
* Identify high-performing products and customer segments.
* Analyze spending patterns based on age, gender, city tier, and occupation.
* Provide actionable insights using data visualization.
🛠 Tools & Libraries Used:

* Python: Core language for data processing
* Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
* NumPy: Numerical operations
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis and presentation

🔍 Analysis Highlights:

* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns).
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find:
    * Average purchase amount by gender and age group.
    * Top product categories during Diwali.
    * Spending trends across cities and occupations.
* Created visual dashboards using bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps for better interpretation.

📈 Business Insights:

* Men tend to spend more than women during Diwali sales.
* Customers aged 26–35 are the most active buyers.
* City Tier 1 has the highest spending per customer.
* Electronics and Clothing are the most purchased product categories.

✅ Outcome:

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to transform raw sales data into strategic business insights. It provides a foundation for building recommendation systems, customer segmentation models, and sales forecasting in retail environments.
